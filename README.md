# Portfolio
Jason Haynberg's professional portfolio of coding projects

**Sudoku**

Generates a random sudoku board and allows user to either manually solve or employ a sloving algorithm. The solving algorithm is implemented in two ways: one using backtracking and another using projection via Douglas Rachford splitting.

Technologies used: C++





**Snake Game**

Allows user to play Snake via a GUI interface and live keyboard input. 

Technologies used: Java, Swing





**Poker Simulation**

Displays the dealing of a five card poker hand to two players and evaluates the winner.

Technologies used: Java, Swing





**Stock Market Simulation with Real-Time Data API**

Allows the user to manage their portfolio using a curated stock market with prices that are updated via API calls.

Technologies Used: Java, JSON, HTTP





**Handwritten Digit Simulation**

Trains 3 different models to predict whether or not images contain handwritten digits and compares their accuracies. The types of models that are created are an SVM, random forest, and k-neareast neighbors.

Technologies Used: Python, Sklearn





**Plant Identification Neural Network**

Trains a Multi-Layer Perceptron model to identify plants species based on 4 physical attributes. The accuracy of the model is evaluated and displayed graphically.

Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-learn
